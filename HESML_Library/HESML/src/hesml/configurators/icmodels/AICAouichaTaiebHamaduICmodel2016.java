/**
 * This class implements the IC model introduced in the paper below.
 * However, the score(c) function is ill-defined in equation (27) of
 * the paper below. In equation (27), the score(c) function includes
 * a term defined as -log(1/depth); however, the last term goes to
 * -infinity for any direct child of the root, because of the root depth
 * is 0. Thus, the IC model implemented herein has not been evaluated
 * and we suggest to any reader to ask the authors of this IC model
 * in order to clarify the aforementioned problems. Basically, the
 * authors should explain what is the exact definition of node depth
 * used by them in order to define the score function in equation (27),
 * because of this equation is ill-conditioned for a base-0 depth in which
 * the root depth takes a zero value. In the examples shown in the
 * paper below, the root depth is defined to 0; however, with this value
 * the equation (27) is ill-defined on the child concepts from the root.
