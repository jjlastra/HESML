The IS5 element supplies two FNR consensus sites at positions 292.5 and 2131 which could serve as the FNR regulatory sites of dcuC * .	Due to this situation , the FNR ( 1 ) consensus site ( Fig. 1 ) could be used for FNR-dependent regulation of dcuC and dcuC * as well .	2	3	3
In this case , the IS5 element would cause increased dcuC * expression by indirect effects , e.g. , topological changes at the dcuC * promoter .	Alternatively , other ( upstream ) FNR regulatory sites could be used in dcuC and dcuC * .	0	1	3
This would mean that the IS5 element is able to provide FNR regulatory sites if inserted at appropriate positions .	In any case , insertion of an IS5 element is able to increase FNR-dependent expression or to place genes under FNR control .	4	4	4
In any case , insertion of an IS5 element is able to increase FNR-dependent expression or to place genes under FNR control .	IS5 elements frequently have been identiﬁed in or at promoters with altered expression of anaerobic pathways genes in E. coli ( 2 , 14 , 20 ) .	2	3	3
IS5 elements frequently have been identiﬁed in or at promoters with altered expression of anaerobic pathways genes in E. coli ( 2 , 14 , 20 ) .	IS5 therefore could be important for the evolution of anaerobic pathways , either by inserting new regulatory sites or by changing the quality of adjacent promoters by affecting DNA topology .	2	3	3
It is synthesized only in the absence of oxygen and nitrate and in the presence of C-4 dicarboxylates ( 4 , 6 , 7 , 27 ) .	DcuA is expressed constitutively in aerobic and anaerobic growth and can substitute for DcuB ( 7 , 22 ) .	1	2	2
These ﬁndings suggest a different physiological role for DcuC and use under different conditions .	To obtain a clue as to the role of DcuC , the functions of Dcu and the conditions for Dcu synthesis were studied .	3	2	2
The resulting 0.5-kb DNA fragment was cloned into the SmaI and BamHI sites of pJL29 to create plasmid pMW122 .	The gene fusions were transferred to the genome of E. coli MC4100 with phage lRZ5 ( 1 , 17 , 21 ) .	1	1	1
Transport of C4-dicarboxylates in cell suspensions of bacteria was measured by silicone oil centrifugation .	For measurement of exchange , the bacteria were loaded with succinate and the uptake of [ 14C ] fumarate was measured by silicone oil centrifugation ( 5 , 22 , 26 ) .	2	1	2
The conditions for DcuC expression were studied with a dcuC9-9lacZ reporter gene fusion ( Fig. 1 ) .	The dcuC gene was fused in frame to 9lacZ to obtain a translational protein fusion .	3	3	3
The dcuC gene was fused in frame to 9lacZ to obtain a translational protein fusion .	The fusion contained the complete promoter region up to position 2971 and seven codons of dcuC .	2	1	2
The fusion contained the complete promoter region up to position 2971 and seven codons of dcuC .	The dcuC9-9lacZ fusion was inserted with phage lRZ5 into the genome of E. coli MC4100 , and monolysogenic strains were used ( Table 2 ) .	1	1	2
Malate , aspartate , asparagine , and tartrate stimulated expression in a manner similar to that of fumarate ( data not shown ) , whereas other carboxylic acids , including malonate , did not cause induction .	When glucose was replaced during anaerobic growth by glycerol or other C sources , the expression of dcuC increased only negligibly , indicating that dcuC is not subject to glucose repression ( Table 2 ) .	1	2	1
When glucose was replaced during anaerobic growth by glycerol or other C sources , the expression of dcuC increased only negligibly , indicating that dcuC is not subject to glucose repression ( Table 2 ) .	Transcriptional regulators controlling dcuC expression .	1	1	1
Transcriptional regulators controlling dcuC expression .	The expression of dcuC9-9lacZ in mutants deﬁcient in regulators responding to electron acceptors was studied ( Table 2 ) .	2	2	1
The expression of dcuC9-9lacZ in mutants deﬁcient in regulators responding to electron acceptors was studied ( Table 2 ) .	The fnr mutant , lacking the O2-responsive regulator FNR , was completely devoid of dcuC9-9lacZ expression during aerobic and anaerobic growth .	1	3	3
The fnr mutant , lacking the O2-responsive regulator FNR , was completely devoid of dcuC9-9lacZ expression during aerobic and anaerobic growth .	The arcA mutant , which is deﬁcient in the O2-responsive regulator ArcA ( 9 ) , showed only a twofold decrease in dcuC9-9lacZ expression under anaerobic conditions .	3	2	4
The arcA mutant , which is deﬁcient in the O2-responsive regulator ArcA ( 9 ) , showed only a twofold decrease in dcuC9-9lacZ expression under anaerobic conditions .	Therefore , anaerobic induction of dcuC is affected by both regulators , but FNR plays the major role .	2	2	3
Mutants lacking the fumarate response regulator DcuR ( dcuR gene ) or the related CitB response regulator ( citB gene ) ( 27 ) showed the same fumarate stimulation of dcuC expression as the wild type .	Thus fumarate stimulation of dcuC must be affected by a different regulatory system .	3	3	3
The lack of glucose repression suggests that DcuC plays a role in glucose fermentation , e.g. , succinate efﬂux , when only the ( constitutive ) DcuA carrier is produced as well .	Accordingly , the low rates of transport of DcuC are sufﬁcient for succinate export during fermentation ( up to 0.2 mol of succinate/mol of glucose ) but not for fumarate-succinate exchange in fumarate respiration .	2	2	1
The expression of dcuC was not signiﬁcantly inhibited by glucose , assigning a role to DcuC during glucose fermentation .	The inactivation of dcuC increased fumarate-succinate exchange and fumarate uptake by DcuA and DcuB , suggesting a preferential function of DcuC in succinate efﬂux during glucose fermentation .	3	3	3
When dcuB was inactivated in the strains , exchange and uptake activities for C4-dicarboxy-lates decreased about two - to sixfold compared to those in the parental strains .	This result is in agreement with the important role of DcuB in these transport reactions of anaerobically growing E. coli .	3	2	3
This result is in agreement with the important role of DcuB in these transport reactions of anaerobically growing E. coli .	However , when dcuC was inactivated , exchange and uptake activities increased compared to those in the parental strains .	1	2	2
However , when dcuC was inactivated , exchange and uptake activities increased compared to those in the parental strains .	The surprising ﬁnding that inactivation of a carrier increased exchange and uptake activities for the same substrates can be explained by assuming that DcuC counteracts the exchange and uptake activities effected by DcuA and DcuB and that DcuC preferentially acts as an efﬂux carrier in E. coli cells .	3	3	3
The inactivation of dcuC increased fumarate-succinate exchange and fumarate uptake by DcuA and DcuB , suggesting a preferential function of DcuC in succinate efﬂux during glucose fermentation .	Upon overexpression in a dcuC promoter mutant ( dcuC * ) , DcuC was able to compensate for DcuA and DcuB in fumarate-succinate exchange and fumarate uptake .	2	3	3
The dcuA dcuB double mutant grows only slowly on glycerol plus fumarate ( 22 , 26 ) .	From the double mutant , a spontaneous mutant which had regained full anaerobic growth on glycerol plus fumarate was obtained .	2	3	3
The expression of dcuC in the mutant ( dcuC * ) was determined with a dcuC * 9-9lacZ fusion .	The expression of dcuC * 9-9lacZ was increased by a factor of about 2.2 compared to that in the wild type , but the responses to oxygen , nitrate , and the regulators FNR , NarL , and NarP were comparable to those in the wild type ( data not shown ) .	2	2	2
In wild-type E. coli , DcuC supports only slow growth by fumarate respiration ( 26 ) .	By using the dcuC * mutant , we tested whether this ﬁnding was due to restricted functioning of DcuC in the antiport mode or to limiting transport rates .	1	2	3
In Fig. 2 , the fumarate-succinate antiport activities in strains containing only dcuC or dcuC * are related to the rates of growth on glycerol plus fumarate .	The increase in fumarate-succinate antiport in the dcuC * strain ( about two-fold ) compared to that in the strain containing only dcuC was similar to the increase in dcuC or dcuC * expression and was paralleled by a similar increase in the rate of growth on glycerol plus fumarate .	3	2	3
The transcriptional start sites of dcuC and dcuC * were determined with mRNA isolated from strains carrying either dcuC or dcuC * .	In primer extension experiments , transcripts of the same length were produced from the mRNAs of both strains ( Fig. 3 ) and started 116 bp upstream of the supposed translational start sites ( 26 ) .	1	1	1
In dcuC , the transcriptional start site is preceded by two potential FNR consensus sites and one half-site between positions 233.5 and 2115.5 .	Therefore , dcuC lacks a typical FNR binding site at position 241.5 ( class II site ) ( 8 , 11 ) .	3	3	3
It seems likely that NikR senses high concentrations of nickel through interactions of this metal with its C-terminal domain .	Indeed , a fragment corresponding to the C-terminal domain of E. coli NikR stably folds in solution , is a monomer , and binds nickel ~ P.T. Chivers & R.T. Sauer , unpubl .	3	3	3
The b-a-a motif is only 45 -- 50 residues in length and contains no residues that are absolutely conserved .	The pairwise identity between sequences of members of different subfamilies is generally only 10 to 15 % , with only a few cases in which identities are .20 % ~ Table 4 ! .	1	1	1
In the cocrystal structures of Arc , CopG , and MetJ , each ribbon-helix-helix dimer binds to a DNA site of 8 -- 10 bp , and residues from the b-sheet mediate most of the sequence specific contacts with DNA bases in the major groove ~ Somers & Phillips , 1992 ; Raumann et al. , 1994b ; Gomis-Rüth et al. , 1998 ! .	Dimers can bind cooperatively to adjacent DNA subsites , although the regions of each protein used for these cooperative protein -- protein interactions are different .	1	2	3
Thermal melts were performed with 1.25 mM protein in S buffer using a 1 min equilibration time and a 30 s averaging time for each 1 8C temperature increment .	GuHCl melts were performed with a stirred 2 mL solution of 6.25 mM protein in S buffer from which aliquots were removed and replaced with an equal volume of 6.25 mM protein in S buffer plus 6 M GuHCl .	2	2	2

Samples from footprinting experiments were run on 8 % polyacrylamide gels containing 8.3 M urea and 1 3 TBE .

The Arc structure scored highest against four of the five NikR N-terminal domain sequences and was the second highest hit for the remaining sequence , although the statistical significance of these scores was borderline ~ Table 2 ! .	Nevertheless , both profile searches and structure prediction suggest that NikR is a member of the ribbon-helix-helix protein family .	2	2	3
Mutation of a residue predicted to be important for DNA-binding reduces operator affinity but does not affect the secondary structure or stability of the protein .	Keywords : nickel permease ; protein folding ; repressor ; sequence homology ; sequence profile ; structure prediction	1	0	0
In equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation , the N-terminal domain sedimented with a mean molecular weight of 11.5 kDa , close to the value expected for a dimer of 6.4 kDa subunits ~ Fig. 4 ! .	The secondary structure of the NikR N-terminal domain was lost in a cooperative fashion in both thermal and GuHCl denaturation ~ Fig. 3B , C !	2	0	1
These results confirm that the N-terminal domain of NikR is responsible for DNA recognition .	In preliminary experiments , we have also found that a subset of mutations within the DNA region protected by the N-terminal domain reduce the affinity of NikR for the operator ~ data not shown ! .	3	3	3
Primer extension analysis in the strain ECL4010 [ F ( adhE9-9lacZ ) 291 ] showed that , as expected , the transcriptional start site was at position 2188 ( Fig. 3 ) .	The results taken together suggest that the downstream transcriptional start site ( 2188 ) can be functional by itself and that the promoter region in this fragment contains the necessary structure for response to redox regulation .	1	3	2
Similar results were obtained when the protein fusions were used ( data not shown ) .	We also determined the AdhE activity levels in cell extracts of these two strains grown under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and found the results concordant with the b-galac-tosidase activity levels ( data not shown ) .	0	2	1
The reduction of acetyl-coenzyme A ( CoA ) to ethanol is essential for disposing of excess reducing equivalents by Esch-erichia coli when respiratory pathways fail to maintain redox balance .	For instance , genetic blockage of the ethanol pathway prevents fermentative growth on glucose or mannitol as a sole carbon and energy source .	0	1	3
The NarL box comprises two heptamer inverted repeats ( TACYYMT , where Y is C or T and M is A or C ) separated by 2 bases ( 8 ) .	Sequence scanning revealed a putative site , TACCCAG-N2-GTGAGTA , located between positions 2199 and 2213 from the translational start site , differing from the consensus in only 1 base in each heptamer ( Fig. 1 ) .	1	2	2
The two-step reduction of acetylCoA to ethanol is catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme encoded by the adhE gene ( Fig. 1 ) located at 27.9 min ( 7 , 10 , 13 , 16 , 21 , 24 ) .	In addition , this protein also functions as a deactivase of pyruvate-formate lyase ( 13 , 14 ) .	1	0	1
We found that , in the wild-type background , the increase in activity level occurred abruptly at the onset of stationary phase ( Fig. 4 , top left panel ) .	In the fnr : : Tn10 rpoS1 background , there was a sixfold increase in activity at the onset of stationary phase ( OD600 , 2.0 ) , but the levels reproducibly dropped 50 % afterwards , possibly resulting from speciﬁc protein degradation in the absence of Fnr-promoted synthesis ( Fig. 4 , top right panel ) .	1	1	2
In the fnr : : Tn10 rpoS1 background , there was a sixfold increase in activity at the onset of stationary phase ( OD600 , 2.0 ) , but the levels reproducibly dropped 50 % afterwards , possibly resulting from speciﬁc protein degradation in the absence of Fnr-promoted synthesis ( Fig. 4 , top right panel ) .	By contrast , in the fnr1 rpoS : : kan background , there was no increase in the activity level until the culture was 5 h into the stationary phase , eventually reaching ﬁve times that found in the exponential-phase cells ( Fig. 4 , bottom left panel ) .	2	2	2
It appears that the relatively early increase in the enzyme activity level in the fnr : : Tn10 rpoS1 cells reﬂected RpoS transcriptional activation following the onset of stationary phase , whereas the relatively late increase in the enzyme activity level in the fnr1 rpoS : : kan cells reﬂected Fnr transcriptional activation in gradual response to anoxia .	This interpretation is consistent with the ﬁnding of a low level of b-galactosidase activity throughout the growth cycle in the fnr : : Tn10 rpoS : : kan double mutant ( Fig. 4 , bottom right panel ) .	2	1	3
Since the RpoS effect was unexpected , we tested whether a similar inﬂuence was exerted by the regulator on the fulllength promoter .	We found that strain ECL4013 [ F ( adhE-lacZ ) 656 ] also exhibited a 10-fold increase in the b-galactosi-dase activity level during stationary phase .	1	1	0
In further support of the RBS occlusion model , we found that when the lacZ open reading frame possessing its own RBS was placed sufﬁciently downstream of the adhE RBS , as in the case of the F ( adhE-lacZ ) 656 operon fusion ( Fig. 2A ) , the synthesis of b-galactosidase also became RNase III independent ( compare strain ECL4013 with strain ECL4017 ) .	As expected , the b-galactosidase activity level spec-iﬁed by the F ( adhE-lacZ ) 656 protein fusion ( in which the translation of lacZ depended on the adhE RBS [ Fig. 2F ] ) remained RNase III dependent ( compare strain ECL4012 with strain ECL4016 ) .	3	3	3
Quantitative evidence for the silencing of the downstream start site by the upstream start region .	Two approaches were designed to test the hypothesis that the upstream promoter region ( up to position 2656 ) acts as a silencer of downstream transcription .	3	3	3
Two approaches were designed to test the hypothesis that the upstream promoter region ( up to position 2656 ) acts as a silencer of downstream transcription .	First , if the downstream promoter is ordinarily not contributing to the net transcription of adhE , then a F ( adhE-lacZ ) fusion containing the 2292 , but not the 2188 , transcriptional start site should express lacZ at an undiminished level .	1	1	2
When grown aerobically , this strain showed a b-galactosidase activity level 60 % lower than that of the strain bearing the F ( adhE-lacZ ) 656 operon fusion with the wild-type promoter sequence .	When grown anaerobically , strain ECL4054 [ F ( adhE-lacZ ) 656TATA ] did not show an increase in b-galactosidase activity ( data not shown ) , conﬁrming that even the presence of a nonfunctional upstream promoter region prevents transcription from position 2188 .	2	2	2
The accumulation of reducing equivalents , possibly the NADH concentration or the NADH/NAD ratio , was suggested to be a signal for transcriptional regulation of adhE ( 5 , 15 ) .	Three transcriptional proteins involved in the control of adhE expression have been identiﬁed , but none of them is directly responsible for redox regulation .	2	2	2
There may well be other acquired biochemical functions yet to be discovered .	For instance , we do not yet know the biological signiﬁcance of spirosome structures arising from the AdhE mole-cules ( 13 , 14 ) .	0	1	2
The key enigma , highlighted by this study , is the presence of two transcriptional start sites in the adhE promoter .	The actual existence of the transcript starting at position 2188 in cell extracts ( 1 ) and the ability of Fnr to activate the anaerobic expression of the 59-truncated F ( adhE-lacZ ) 291 fusion suggest that under certain conditions the silencer effect of the upstream promoter region can be lifted to allow signiﬁcant transcription at the 2188 site .	1	2	2
The second protein , Cra ( for catabolite repressor activator ) , represses adhE expression ( 19 ) , but this transcriptional regulator is functional only when complexed with fructose-1-phosphate or fructose-1 ,6 - bisphosphate as an effector ( for a review , see reference 22 ) .	The third protein , Fis ( for factor for inversion stimulation ) ( 9 , 28 ) , is required for adhE transcription , but Fis is not known to require any effector for function and the expression of the ﬁs gene itself is independent of the respiratory condition of growth ( 18 ) .	2	2	2
It was suggested that intramolecular base pairing occludes the RBS ( ribosomal binding site ) and that cleavage of the obstructing secondary structure liberates the translation .	The results of primer extension experiments indicated two putative adhE transcriptional start sites : one at position 2292 and the other at position 2188 from the translational start codon ATG ( 1 ) .	1	0	0
The results of primer extension experiments indicated two putative adhE transcriptional start sites : one at position 2292 and the other at position 2188 from the translational start codon ATG ( 1 ) .	However , the mRNA starting at position 2188 was not seriously considered for three reasons : ( i ) the primer extension might be prematurely terminated by a secondary structure of the full-length adhE mRNA , ( ii ) the short transcript starting at position 2188 might be a breakdown product , and ( iii ) transcription from this site was not likely to require RNase III cleavage as predicted by the RBS occlusion model .	2	2	3
Strains , culture conditions , and reagents .	The relevant characteristics and sources of the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are given in Table 1 .	3	2	1
In this study we show , by using several different transcriptional and translational fusions to the lacZ gene , that both putative transcriptional start sites can be functional and each site can be redox regulated .	Although both start sites are NarL repressible in the presence of nitrate , Fnr activates only the 2188 start site and Fis is required for the transcription of only the 2292 start site .	1	2	1
To construct lADHop2656 ( operon fusion ) , primers 2656-5 ( 59-AGCGAGATCCACAAGATAATGGCC-39 ) and 2656-3 ( 59-A GCTGGATCCGTAAGCAAGATTACTCACTTCTGGG-39 ) were used to amplify a 0.3-kb DNA fragment comprising a segment from position 2656 to position 2190 from the adhE translational start site .	To construct lADHop3656 ( operon fusion ) , primers 3656-5 ( 59-AGCGGATCCACAAGATAATGGCC-39 ) and 3656-3 ( 59-CGCTGGATCCCATTATAGCTAACAGTTAATAAATTGTAGTATG-39 ) were used to amplify a 0.4-kb DNA fragment comprising a segment from position 2656 to position 2267 from the adhE translational start site .	3	2	3
In addition , it was discovered that RpoS activates adhE transcription at both start sites .	Under all experimental conditions tested , however , only the upstream start site is active .	0	1	2
The cultures were then pelleted , suspended in 2.5 ml of Z buffer ( 20 ) , and kept on ice .	Speciﬁc b-galactosidase activity in cells permeabilized with chloroform and sodium dodecyl sulfate was assayed at 28 °C and is expressed in Miller units ( DOD420 per minute per OD600 unit ) ( 20 ) .	0	0	1
Under all experimental conditions tested , however , only the upstream start site is active .	Available evidence indicates that under those conditions , the upstream promoter region acts as a silencer of the downstream transcriptional start site .	1	1	2
To test whether the downstream transcriptional start site was functional , we constructed two pairs of adhE-lac fusions differing in the lengths of their promoter regions : ( i ) a F ( adhE-lacZ ) 656 operon fusion and a F ( adhE9-9lacZ ) 656 protein fusion extending to position 2656 from the translational start site ( Fig. 2A and F ) and ( ii ) a F ( adhE-lacZ ) 291 operon fusion and a F ( adhE9-9lacZ ) 291 protein fusion extending to position 2291 from the translational start site ( Fig. 2B and G ) .	The pair of long fusions contained both the 2292 and 2188 transcriptional start sites , whereas the pair of short fusions contained only the 2188 transcriptional start site .	1	1	2
Translation of the mRNA starting at 2292 , but not the one starting at 2188 , requires RNase III .	The results support the previously postulated ribosomal binding site ( RBS ) occlusion model , according to which RNase III cleavage is required to release the RBS from a stem-loop structure in the long transcript .	2	2	3
In summary , the results presented here indicate that ArcA and Fnr regulatory proteins play a role in repression of the E. coli tpx gene under anaerobic growth conditions .	The dual control of tpx gene expression regulated by ArcA and Fnr proteins appears to provide maximum protection against the toxicity of oxidative stress during aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions .	3	3	3
In the present work , we analyse the in vivo roles of the two sites bound by Fnr in vitro within the cydAB promoter region by examining the effects of point mutations created in each site on the expression of the cydAB promoters .	The results below indicate that ( i ) the cydAB operon is transcribed from a complex element containing three other promoters in addition to the two previously identified ( Cotter et al. , 1997 ) ; ( ii ) promoters P1 , P2 , P3 and P4 are co-ordinately regulated by oxygen , ArcA and Fnr ; ( iii ) the P5 promoter is not strongly regulated and provides a significant fraction of the total cydAB transcription in aerobiosis ; ( iv ) the Fnr-2 site is essential for anaerobic repression of the four regulated promoters and , in particular , an intact right half-site is required for proper recognition by Fnr ; ( v ) the Fnr-1 site plays an auxiliary role in the repression of P1 , P3 and P4 , but not P2 .	3	3	3
Fifthly , a small reduction ( up to < 1.6-fold ) in anaerobic cyd ± lacZ expression was observed for several Fnr site mutants in a Dfnr background , suggesting that some of the mutations may also have Fnr-independent effects on gene expression .	Finally , these Fnr-independent effects may result from altered ArcA activation , rather than from altered basal promoter activity , as none of the Fnr site mutations altered cyd ± lacZ expression in wild-type cells grown in the presence of oxygen , or in an anaerobically grown DarcA strain ( data not shown ) .	3	3	3
We also found that BSN27 and MWK6 showed similar ClyA activity on blood agar ( Table 3 ) and quantiﬁed lytic activity using the erythrocyte assay ( data not shown ) .	This was in accordance with overproduction of SlyA in the hns clyA : : luxAB strain JON34/pJON22 ( data not shown ) , in the hns strain JON31/pJON22 , and in the hns slyA strain MWK6/pJON22 ( Table 3 ) , which did not result in an additive effect on ClyA expression compared with the control strains JON34/pACYC177 , JON31/pACYC177 , and MWK6 / pACYC177 .	0	2	2
In addition , the overexpression of SlyA in the hns strain JON31/pJON22 , the hns clyA : : luxAB strain JON34/pJON22 , and the hns slyA strain MWK6/pJON22 , did not result in a further elevation of ClyA expression .	Based on our ﬁndings , demonstrating no absolute requirement of SlyA for ClyA expression , but rather a copy number effect , we suggest that SlyA may not be involved speciﬁcally in the natural regulation of clyA .	3	3	3
The observed regulatory effects on clyA with SlyA ( and likely also MprA ) may well be of a more general nature , e.g. , competing with H-NS binding at the clyA locus .	It has been suggested that SlyA-related proteins play key roles in the global regulation of diverse aspects of bacterial physiology ( 57 ) .	2	1	1
In contrast , the altered CRP binding site that matched the consensus more closely resulted in substantially increased ClyA expression in crp1 but not crp strains .	These ﬁndings supported a model in which the clyA promoter is dependent on CRP for efﬁcient expression , and where the predicted DNA site for CRP is important for this regulation .	4	4	4
This was in contrast to the lack of effect of molybdate addition to this strain .	Similarly , the addition of tungstate to the growth medium for strain TL28 ( modC ) gave rise to enhanced moa expression ; however , mo-lybdate addition was without effect .	2	3	3
It is noteworthy that the E. coli strain MG1665 contained a matA transcript , but we failed to amplify a matBC RNA from this strain .	Methylation was started by adding DMS to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM and proceeded for 5 min at 37 °C .	0	1	0

Plasmids designated pUV12 and pUV16 have been described elsewhere ( Vogel and Jensen , 1994 ) and are shown in Fig. 1 .	We also found that Dps co-purified with YchF by Western blotting ( most likely due its small size ) but not by MS. Thus , it is currently unknown whether YchF specifically interacts with Dps and if so whether this interferes with Dps activity .	0	0	0

We conﬁrmed that transcription of qseBC was activated by the AI-2 quorum-sensing system ( Fig. 1 ) , but we do not know whether the presence of AI-2 has any effect on the phosphorylation state of these proteins , which is one of the questions we intend to address in the future .

The addition of nitrate caused a modest reduction in napF gene expression ( Table 2 ) .	The maximum level of frdA-lacZ and dmsA-lacZ expression occurred within 200 min and decreased by 20 and 40 % , respectively , from the peak activities ( Fig. 4 ) .	0	1	1
Region 2.3 , rich in aromatic residues , is implicated in DNA melting and maps in both cases very close to the unpaired segment of the non-template strand .	As a result , OmpR is now able to occupy the activating sites upstream of ompC , leading to the expression of ompC .	1	0	0
We believe that our assignment is the most likely to be correct , because all of the available S. enterica serovar sequences have an additional base inserted upstream of the ATG , and thus the other putative upstream initiation codons are out of frame with the fadE coding sequence .
