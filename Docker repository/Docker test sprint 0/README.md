# HESML-STS --- sprint 0

## Features implemented in HESML-STS --- sprint 0
	- String-based sentence similarity measures
	- Preprocessing methods: Char filtering, stop words removal, tokenizers and lowe casing.
	- Benchmark datasets: BIOSSES, MedSTS, CTR
	- Expriment configuration file: string_benchmark.stsexp
	- R script for post-processing results. Output in .csv and .latex formats.


> Requisites: **Docker installed in an operating system**
## How to run the experiments

1. Download the Dockerfile from this directory
2. Save the file in an empty directory, open a terminal and compile the image (up to 10 minutes):
```sh
[sudo] docker build --no-cache -t hesml_test .
```
3. Create the container. It is not necessary to start the container!
```sh
[sudo] docker create -it --name "hesml_test" hesml_test:latest
```
4. Copy the raw and processed output files into the directory

```sh
[sudo] docker cp hesml_test:/home/user/HESML/HESML/HESML_Library/ReproducibleExperiments/BioSentenceSimilarity_paper/BioSentenceSimFinalProcessedOutputFiles .
```
```sh
[sudo] docker cp hesml_test:/home/user/HESML/HESML/HESML_Library/ReproducibleExperiments/BioSentenceSimilarity_paper/BioSentenceSimFinalRawOutputFiles .
```
